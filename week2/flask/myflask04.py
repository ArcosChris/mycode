   A simple Flask server. This server has the following endpoints:
   
   /success/<name> - responds with 200 + 'Welcome {name}'
   
   /
   /start          - Both endpoints respond with 200 + postmaker.html (template)
   
   /login          - a POST will have the form read for 'nm'
                   - a GET will be scanned for the query param ?nm=some_value"""
